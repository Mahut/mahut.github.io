Hi, my name is Andy Hazoume and thank you for reading my blog.
I am a  Data and Software Engineer Engineer. I have 6 years of experience working as a full stack engineer doing both backend and frontend. On backend I work mostly with Java/Java EE using Spring Framework. Recently, I've dived into building microservices with Python and Flask. On frontend I worked with all major frameworks (AngularJS, Angular 2+, Vue) in both ES6 and TypeScript. For data engineering tasks, I'm fluent mainly in SQL. I can also write custom ETL and use visualization tools like Highcharts and Handsontable.

Apart from Software Engineering, I like reading fantasy, cyberpunk, science-fiction books, and I'm also very interested in cognitive sciences.
