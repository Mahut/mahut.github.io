# Hey
Welcome to my blog! My name is Andy Hazoume. I'm a Software Engineer and a Technical Lead, currently working on Master Data Management (MDM) in the Private Equity industry.

Apart from Software Engineering, I like reading fantasy, cyberpunk, science-fiction books, and I'm also very interested in cognitive sciences.
